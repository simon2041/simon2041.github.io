			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p> <b> Let me shortly introduce my self by showing you where i come from and what brought me to the position i am now clothing and finally were i want to be in the next years.</b><br><br>
 
 			 My passion for technology and all its surrounding topics started very early and evolved during my time in high school. To make this my job, even though the business aspect was quite new to me, seemed to be a natural move, so i decided to launch a small business creating websites for several companies and schools in the area.  <br><br>
 
 			To tie in with my passion of it and economics i decided to study business information management. Since i was used to practically work with technology as a webdeveloper, i decided to take advantage of this and apply for a so called cooperative study system. The cooperative study system allows you to work for a company and studying alongside with the benefits of directly applying the theorie to the real world business. Even though the theory behind the cooperative study systems sounds very appealing,the system is just as good as the cooperative partner you work with.I decided to apply for a study place at IBM as global IT player to take advantages of the tremendous opportunitiesof different job roles you are offered to take part during your practical periods.<br><br>
 
 			During my time at IBM i tried to use this opportunities in order to find the most suitable job role and area to work in.Therefore i spend on the on hand time in very business orientated jobs like transition and transformation management or sales and on the other hand in very technical orientated jobs like research staff member for massively parallel processing databases or architecture and development for kryptographic testing applications. <br><br>
 
 			One of the most important things i learned, besides my working skillset, is to always take a look to the left and right. Even though the strong technical orientation represented a common thread in my personal development, i decided to slightly change the course.During the last years of my studies i gained some insights into the law system. Especially it laws, which
 			represents the overlapping area of it and laws, reaching further than interlectual property and data protection laws, got my attention. This area seemed to have a complex tension in the manner of an pretty much old and by nature slowly developing sience namely law and in contrast the enormously fast developing it fashion. This tension caused my decision personally and professionally evolve in this area. <br><br>
 			I started to work as a security specialist for identity and access management at IBM as this represents an area were technology and different law topics as data protection laws have a considerable friction. Besides my work at IBM i am studying laws at the Leibniz University Hannover to cover every expertise needed for future opportunities.
